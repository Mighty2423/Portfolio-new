    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>I grew up in a military family and moved frequently, which gave me a unique appreciation for adaptability and
      solving new problems. Like many in tech, my journey started with gaming—playing on a Nintendo DS and Wii in the
      mid-2000s. Over time, I learned how to build PCs, read blueprints, and eventually design and deploy real-world
      systems, from workstations and servers to entire databases.</p>

    <p>Hey, I’m Alton White. I was born in Auburn, Washington on February 15, 1999. Growing up in a military family, I
      moved around a lot—ten times, in fact—which gave me a broad view of the U.S. (I’ve seen every state except Alaska
      and California). Being the oldest of four kids taught me early responsibility, and I credit my parents for shaping
      who I am today.</p>

    <p>Outside of tech, I’m passionate about model building, gaming (both tabletop and digital), drawing, and music.
      I’ve been building models with my dad since I was four and now focus on Gundam kits inspired by mecha anime. I’m
      also into Warhammer 40k, Magic: The Gathering, and comics from both Marvel and DC. When I draw, my style is
      heavily influenced by manga and anime.</p>
