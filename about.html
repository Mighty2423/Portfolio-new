    <p>Hello, my name is Alton White. I was born in Auburn on February 15, 1999. Raised in a military family, I moved ten times and have seen all of the U.S. except Alaska and California. As an Air Force brat, I matured quickly in some areas and missed opportunities in others. I’m the eldest of four children and deeply value my parents’ support and influence.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include plastic model building, exercising, drawing, tabletop and video gaming. I play the trombone and trumpet, and I’m a fan of anime and K-dramas. My dad and I built models together since I was four, and I’ve grown to love building Gundam from mecha anime. I’m also into Warhammer 40K, Magic the Gathering, and Marvel/DC comics. I enjoy drawing in a style influenced by manga and anime.</p>
    <p>I achieved my Eagle Scout award in 2016 after digitizing nearly 80 pages of logs for the North Hampton Historical Society. It taught me a lot about delegation and time management. I hold an associate degree in Computer Network Engineering & Cybersecurity from Pierce College and am currently pursuing a bachelor's in CIT.</p>
    <p>My personal motto: “The only thing you can change about the past is how you feel about it in the present.” – Yōsuke Kuroda</p>
